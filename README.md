## support

lara will at its absolute best only ever support versions up to iOS 26.0.1/iOS 18.7.1. the exploit was patched after those versions.

currently tested on iOS 17.1 - 26.0.1, up to iOS 18.7.1 only on the 18.7 series.

## compatibility

| series              | version / chip    | status                    |
| :------------------ | :---------------- | :------------------------ |
| **iOS 17**          | all versions      | supported                 |
| **iOS 18**          | 18.0 — 18.7.1     | supported                 |
| **iOS 26.0/26.0.1** | 26.0 — 26.0.1 **only** | supported            |
| **iOS 26.1+**       | 26.1+             | **patched**               |
| **M-series chips**  | M1 - M4           | partially supported. YMMV |

> [!CAUTION]
> if you are on an M-series device, go to lara settings, scroll down set `t1sz_boot` to `0x11`. if you are on any iOS version higher than 26.0.1 the app will crash on launch. this isn't a bug, lara just doesnt support those devices.
>
> **ISSUES THAT INVOLVE LARA NOT WORKING ON UNSUPPORTED VERSIONS WILL BE CLOSED IMMEDIATELY.**<br>
> **Issues related to lara not working on versions that the exploit DOES technically support will be closed and added to the known issues section**

If you run lara on your device, and it ends up working, please contact me on [discord](https://discord.gg/gw8PcRF3Jr) and tell me:

1. your device
2. your iOS version
3. what you tested in lara (eg. Run Exploit, Init KFS, etc.)

If lara doesnt work on your device, and you want to help the project, please also provide your logs and iOS version.

### fixes

#### about the kernelcache

lara needs the **kernelcache** (the iOS kernel binary from your exact iOS version + device) to run. on first launch it runs a patchfinder ([opa334's XPF](https://github.com/opa334/ChOma) via libgrabkernel2) against the kernelcache to locate the kernel symbols and struct offsets the exploit touches — `kernproc`, `rootvnode`, `proc` size, etc. these move on every iOS release and every SoC, so lara can't ship them hardcoded.

the app tries to download the kernelcache for you automatically (the **Download Kernelcache** button in Settings hits Apple's IPSW servers). when that fails — usually a network/CDN hiccup or an unusual device/build combo — grab one manually with the steps below and import it via **Import Kernelcache from Files**.

if things get weird later, **Delete Kernelcache Data** in Settings wipes the cached kernelcache and the saved offsets, and you start over. that's what the "delete and redownload" line in [tips](#tips) is about.

**kernelcache download fix (manual fallback):**

1. Download the IPSW tool for your device [here](https://github.com/blacktop/ipsw/releases/tag/v3.1.671).
2. Extract the archive.
3. Open Terminal.
4. Navigate to the extracted folder:
   ```sh
   cd /path/to/ipsw_3.1.671_something_something/
   ```
5. Extract the kernel:
   ```sh
   ./ipsw extract --kernel [drag your ipsw here]
   ```
6. Get the kernelcache file.
7. Transfer the kernelcache to your iPhone.
8. In the Files app:
   - Go to "On My iPhone" > "lara"
   - Place the kernelcache file there.
9. Rename the file to `kernelcache` (without extension).

## tips

- deleting and redownloading kernelcache is known to fix many issues. do this before asking me for support.
- closing and reopening the app can fix font change issues.
- respringing is needed to apply springboard changes such as font changes.
